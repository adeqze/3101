Program Description
***************************
A shell script that has three 4 options for sorting a text document with at least fifty words. 

option1: Calls a shell method that sorts this document and puts into another document
	The user is asked for the name of a file that the sorted content would be saved into. 
	A file with the sorted words and with the name the user put will be created in the current directory. 

option2: Calls a perl program that sorts this document and puts into another document.
	Like option 1, the user will be asked to input the name of a file that the sorted words will be put into. 
	A file with the name the user specified contatining the sorted words will be created in the current working directory. 

option3: Calls a perl program that displays the list of words in the file and ask the use to input the word the user wants to 
	 search for in the list. If the words the user input is in the list of words, then a match found message and the line number of
	 the word in the document will be displayed. Else a "Not found" message will be displayed.
	  
Option4: Lets the use exit the program if they wish to exit the program. 

The program keeps running in a while loop until the user decides to exit.

Usage statement
**********************
Start the program by typing:
./lab3 hello.txt

This will run the shell script and you can follow the prompts on the screen. 

Note: hello.txt is the name of the text document with the words. 
      You can choose to use your own file but just make sure it's in the same directory
      as the shell script since directory changing is not implemented in this program.
